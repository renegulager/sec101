With the following:


Confidentiality Impact: 	
Complete (There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed.)

Integrity Impact:
 	Complete (There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised.)
Availability Impact:
 	Complete (There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.)
Access Complexity:
 	Medium (The access conditions are somewhat specialized. Some preconditions must be satistified to exploit)
Authentication:
 	Single system (The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface).)
Gained Access :
	None


The result should be ~8+
